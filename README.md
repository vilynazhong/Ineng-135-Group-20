## Description of the python file -- linear regression 
At the beginning of this project, we were considering whether metal prices are linearly increasing with time or not. To prove this thought, we decided to pick gold as a reference, so we collected the monthly prices of gold from 1950 to July 2020. We split the data by 90% for training and 10 % for testing.  After that, we used a linear regression model from sklearn to build a linear model. We used this model to predict the values from 1950 to 2020,  and we plotted the line of prediction with the scatter of actual values, we could easily observe that the price of gold doesn't have a strong linear association with time. This graph disproofs our thought, even though the overall price went up with time, but it was choppy in the progress. We can see the price exploded more quadratically at some moments for some reasons and had retracements after the explosions. After that observation, we calculated  the mean square errors for the training set and testing set, which are huge!!!


1. Collect Monthly data of gold price.
2. Split the data into testing set and trainning set.
3. Build a linear regression model using sklearn.
4. Predict values.
5. Plot the predicted value and actual value.
6. Calculate the mean square error.
